# Identification and analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell receptors
Classifying the status of COVID samples and SARS-CoV2-specific TCRs

## Background 

T-cell receptors (TCRs) are greatly variable because of VDJ-recombination, which allows
distinguishing TCR clonotypes specific to certain antigen epitopes. Latest studies reveal T-cell
response in COVID-19 cases. Ð¡ertain TCRs that are targeting specific antigens of SARS-CoV-2
were also found. This project aims to identify a set of TCRs that can serve as COVID-19
biomarkers, suggest machine learning methods that can associate individual TCR
repertoires with COVID-19 status and compare existing tools for TCR clustering.

The repository contains following folders:
- ``sample-classifier``  - sample classification based on T-cell repertoire 
- ``epitope-classifier`` - performance evaluation of TCR clustering methods
